# Installation

Midui is **NOT** a component library so there is no need to intall any packages.

However you'll need to install **tailwindcss** for Midui to work.

- [Next.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)
- [React.js (Vite)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
- [Vue.js (Vite)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
- [Others](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides)

If **tailwindcss** is already installed on your project you can directly skip to copy components.
