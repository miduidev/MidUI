- Once its approved by mods you can proceed with modifying the code according to **CONTRIBUTING.md** & opening a new pull request.
- After approving the edits your code will be merged into the repository.

## Updating the docs

To update the docs you can directly change (issue creation not required) the files in the folder `(/data/docs)`.

**Note you can not create new docs files without creating a new issue.**
